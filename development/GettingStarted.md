# Getting Started with Leto

Welcome to our Private Analytics Platform, Leto! We're a private analytics platform specializing in IPFS data! We'll walk you through how to retrieve data from an IPFS Gateway, specifically the Leto Gateway, and how you can query our Analytics Engine.

## Compatible IPFS Providers

Our Leto Gateway can communicate with a range of services, ensuring content is served as swiftly as possible, regardless of the provider. This is achieved through Gateway Racing! Store your content with [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage) and we can not only serve your content but also provide you with private analytics to help you develop better.

The public IPFS Gateways we currently support are Web3.Storage, the IPFS Gateway, and the DWeb Gateway.

## How to Use Leto Analytics

Most developers deliver their IPFS content using an IPFS Gateway of some kind. To incorporate Leto Analytics into your stack, simply use our Gateway. We will then serve your content via our incredibly fast Gateway Mirror. [Gateway APIs](https://letodev.gitbook.io/leto-documentation-1/gateway-api-doc)

If you're serving your content using something other than a gateway, we're working on ways to integrate analytics with your system too!

## Integrating Analytics Query into Your App

If you'd like to integrate the analytics query into your app to provide users with data on how often their content is viewed, you can find the necessary information here: [Analytics APIs](https://letodev.gitbook.io/leto-documentation-1/analytics)
